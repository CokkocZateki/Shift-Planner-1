# Shift-Planner

A shift planner built using Visual Basic. The planner allows employers to sign up for shifts and manage their shifts. They can also apply for overtime shifts that become available and apply for time off.

## Rules

Every team member will be assigned features to implement in the application. Each feature will have it's own branch and will be pushed to master when functionality has been achieved. The master branch will then be tested and issues will be posted in the issues. Fixes will then be applied and pull requests will then take place.
