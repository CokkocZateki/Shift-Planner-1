# Shift-Planner - Database Branch

A shift planner built using Visual Basic. The planner allows employers to sign up for shifts and manage their shifts. They can also apply for overtime shifts that become available and apply for time off.

This is the database branch, which will focus on developing a relational database that store information for the shift planner to use. This branch has an emphasis on developing and testing the database, connecting it to the project and running test queries using dummy data to ensure that it works.

This branch will later be merged with _master_.

# Rules

Every team member will be assigned features to implement in the application. Each feature will have it's own branch and will be pushed to master when functionality has been achieved. The master branch will then be tested and issues will be posted in the issues. Fixes will then be applied and pull requests will then take place.
